## 📋 Abstract

**InstructDiff** is a model-aware, domain-adaptive data selection framework for efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models. By measuring distributional shifts between a base model and a lightly calibrated variant, InstructDiff identifies samples at the model's "learnable frontier" through differential entropy analysis. Our method achieves superior performance across diverse domains while using only 10-20% of training data, demonstrating consistent improvements over full-dataset training and existing selection methods.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Domain-Adaptive**: Single criterion adapts across reasoning, medical, coding, and general instruction-following tasks
- 🚀 **Data-Efficient**: Achieves +17% to +52% relative gains over full training with 10-20% data
- 🔧 **Model-Agnostic**: Works across different model families and scales
- 📊 **Theoretically Grounded**: Based on differential entropy and information theory principles
- 🔄 **Iterative Refinement**: Optional multi-round selection for additional performance gains

InstructDiff addresses the challenge of efficient fine-tuning by identifying high-value training samples through three key components:

1. **Warmup Calibration**: Establishes an instruction-aware reference model via lightweight fine-tuning
2. **Bi-Directional NLL Filtering**: Removes redundant (too easy) and incomprehensible (too hard) samples
3. **Differential Entropy Ranking**: Selects domain-adaptive samples based on distributional shift magnitude

---

## Quickstart

Install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Sample and train (medical example):

```bash
# sample 100 from first 1k
instdiff sample --config configs/med/sample_med_1k_100.yaml

# train on 100 samples
instdiff train --config configs/med/train_med_100.yaml

# run iterative pipeline (2 rounds)
instdiff pipeline --config configs/med/pipeline_med_iter.yaml
instdiff pipeline --config configs/med/pipeline_med_iter2.yaml
```

Outputs are written under `runs/`.

## 🧪 Methodology

**Stage 1 - Warmup Calibration**
- Fine-tune the base model on a small random subset.
- Use the calibrated model as a reference for distributional measurements.

**Stage 2 - Distribution-Aware Selection**
- Compute per-sample delta NLL and delta entropy between base and calibrated models.
- Apply bi-directional NLL filtering to retain the learnable middle range.
- Rank the remaining samples by delta entropy and select the lowest values.

**Iterative Refinement (optional)**
- Repeat selection using the newly fine-tuned model as the next calibration reference.

## 📈 Experimental Results

### Main Results

Performance comparison across four domains with 10% data selection (20% for code). Results demonstrate InstructDiff's consistent superiority over baselines.

| Method | Math (Avg) | General (Avg) | Medical (Avg) | Code (Avg) |
|:-------|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Base Model | 12.61 | 0.81 | 47.87 | 39.6 |
| Full Training (100%) | 27.05 | 4.93 | 53.14 | 43.0 |
| Random Sampling | 25.80 | 3.81 | 46.76 | 40.8 |
| IFD | 21.99 | 6.52 | 44.59 | 37.1 |
| SelectIT | 24.35 | 5.09 | 42.96 | 44.4 |
| ZIP | 22.61 | 3.84 | 54.41 | 39.4 |
| Superfiltering | 25.31 | 7.35 | 38.29 | 39.4 |
| **InstructDiff (Ours)** | **31.63** | **7.47** | **56.42** | **45.1** |
| *Relative Gain vs. Full* | ***+17%*** | ***+52%*** | ***+6.2%*** | ***+4.9%*** |

**Key Findings**:
- InstructDiff is the **only method** that consistently outperforms full-data training across all domains
- Achieves superior results with **10-20% of training data** (90% reduction in training cost)
- Demonstrates robust performance across diverse model families (Qwen, LLaMA) and task types

**Detailed benchmark breakdown**: See original paper for per-benchmark results including AIME24 (7.71), Math-OAI (61.79), AlpacaEval (12.09%), HumanEval (48.2), MedQA (54.67), and more.

## 🔬 Analysis and Findings

**Bi-Directional NLL Filtering**: Essential component; removing it causes -2.59 to -5.56 performance drops across domains.

**Warmup Size**: 10% warmup ratio provides optimal balance (31.63 avg on math); smaller ratios lack calibration, larger ones reduce selection pool.

**Scaling**: Maintains effectiveness on large pools (100k samples); outperforms baselines consistently.

**Cross-Model Transfer**: High overlap within model families (64% recall Qwen2.5-7B ↔ 14B); low across families (~15%). Same-family calibration performs best.

**Weak-to-Strong**: Small models (0.5B, 1.5B) can guide selection for larger models with +10% gains, though self-calibration remains optimal.

**Iterative Refinement**: Yields +4.0% (round 2) and +1.1% (round 3) improvements; 2-3 rounds recommended for best results.
